    <p class="description">Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer[a] (a shortening of
        the word
        "association"), is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by
        approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular
        sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game
        is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the
        higher number of goals wins the game.</p>
